<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a very simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using Flutter framework. This is my first attempt in Flutter + Dart based App development. The App takes Weight and Height as user inputs and calculates BMI using the formula BMI = Weight/(Height*Height). App also displays the status of the BMI result.
